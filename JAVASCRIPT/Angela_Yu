# 100 Random number generation
var n = Math.random();
This generates number from 0 to 0.9999999999

To get desired number let's say 1 to 6

1. Multiply n by 6 => Increase its range 0 to 5.999999.....
2. Either ceil it / add +1 then floor it

    var n = Math.ceil(Math.random()*6);
    console.log(n);
