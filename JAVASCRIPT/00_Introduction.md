# The script Tag

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between < script > and < /script > tags.

Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: 

    <script type="text/javascript">





    

The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.

- You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

- Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.

- Placing scripts at the bottom of the body element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

- Scripts can also be placed in external files:

- JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

- To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a script tag,
To add several script files to one pageÂ  - use several script tags:

    < script src="myScript1.js"></script> 

    < script src="myScript2.js"></script>
