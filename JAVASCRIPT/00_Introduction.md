JAVA SCRIPT HISTORY :-

Netscape Navigator, the browser that dominated the 90s.
Marc Andreessen who was one of the principle makers of the Netscape Navigator.
And at one point Netscape Navigator held over 80 percent of the market share in terms of browser usage.

So in order to do make it interactive that does't need servers in b/w by creating a small scripting language.
The requirements were that this language had to be simple and had to be really easy so that even non-developers and non-programmers could use it to add functionality to web sites.
So they contracted Brendan Eich, to create that programming language.
Brendan was able to create Javascript in 10 days.

Different versions of Javascript not referred to as JS5 or JS6 but as ES6 or ES7, and the ES comes of course from ECMAscript.
