DOM : document object model

HOW TO USE JS WITH OUR WEBPAGE ?

1. INLINE
    
    This would be chaos!!

        <body onload = "alert('Hello');">

2. INTERNAL

        <script type = "text/javascript">
            alert("Hello World");
        </script>

3. EXTERNAL 

        <script src ="aaa.js"></script>


Positioning of script tags matters a lot!! 
that's why we always put css on top as execution begins from top to bottom

**BEST PRACTICE** : PUT JS AT LAST AND CSS ON TOP
