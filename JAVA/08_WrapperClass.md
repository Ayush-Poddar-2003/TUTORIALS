Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types as objects as java is 99% oops

    int -> Integer
    char -> Character
    byte -> Byte
    short -> Short
    long -> Long
    float -> Float
    double -> Double
    boolean -> Boolean

## Use of wrapper class
- Change the value in Method: Java supports only call by value. So, if we pass a primitive value, it will not change the original value. But, if we convert the primitive value in an
object, it will change the original value.
- java.util package: The java.util package provides the utility classes to deal with objects.
- Collection Framework: Java collection framework works with objects only. All classes of the collection framework
- Serialization: We need to convert the objects into streams to perform the serialization. If we have a primitive value, we can convert it in objects through the wrapper classes.
- Synchronization: Java synchronization works with objects in Multithreading.
(ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, etc.) deal with objects only.

```java
int y = 10;
String str = "5";

y = str      // will give error
y = (int)str // will give error

// Bcoz We are putting greater thing in small container        

// also when we take input from user we take it in text box in form of string and to perform computation we need wrapper class

y = Integer.parseInt(str) //Correct
```
```java
Uses :-

// To create objects 
Integer a = new Integer(5);

// We can assign null to objects
int a = null // INVALID
Integer a = null // VALID
```

## AUTOBOXING

```java
int a = 5;
double b = 5.5;

Integer aa = Integer.valueof(a);
Double bb = Double.valueof(b);
```

## UNBOXING
```JAVA
Integer aa = Integer.valueof(5);
Double bb = Double.valueof(5.5);

int a = aa.intValue()
double b = bb.doubleValue()
```

## Difference between int and Integer

- The Integer class is an Object while an int is a primitive type.
- The Integer is compared with .equals while the int uses two equal signs, == .
- The Integer class is a wrapper class for the int, while the int is not a class at all.
- The Integer class allows conversion to float, double, long and short, while the int doesnâ€™t.
- Java int simply represents a whole number, while an Integer has additional properties and methods. 
- The Object class is not an ancestor of the int.

you can initialize Integer types in Java multiple ways, including:
- Through a constructor.
- From the value of a String.
- With the help of autoboxing.

        Integer number = new Integer(10); // constructor
        Integer dozen = Integer.valueOf("20"); // convert String to int
        Integer century = 100; // autoboxing
