### Final Keyword
If you don't want to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only

    final int myNum = 15;
    myNum = 20;  // will generate an error
<br>

### OUTPUT

If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation:

    String x = "10";
    int y = 20;
    String z = x + y;  // z will be 1020 (a String)
