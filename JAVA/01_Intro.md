```java
    class Ayush{  
        public static void main ( String args[] ){  
            System.out.println("Hello Java");  
        }  
    }  
```

- class : declares a class
- public : access modifier
- static : No need to create an object
- void : Return type
- main : represents the starting point
- String[] args or String args[] : is used for command line argument.
