Java is one of the most popular programming languages.

Java's slogan is "Write once, run anywhere". Java programs can run on different platforms, including mobile, desktop, and other portable systems. You can use Java to build apps, games, banking applications, web apps, and much more!

ðŸ’¡ You can write code that generates outputs with the System.out.println() statement
ðŸ’¡ The println instruction needs to be followed by parentheses

    System.out.println("Write once, run anywhere!");

ðŸ’¡ Java is a case-sensitive language.

    class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hi there");
    }
    }

The first line of the code defines a class called Demo.


# VARIABLES
A variable lets you store a value by assigning it to a name. The name can be used to refer to the value later in the program.
