
# In python, we can take user input directly by using input() function.
# This input function gives a return value as string hence we have to pass that into a variable

# Syntax: variable = input()

# Since input function returns the value as string, Hence we have to typecast accordingly.

var1 = int(input())
var2 = float(input())

# We can also display a text using input function.

a=input("Enter the name: ")
