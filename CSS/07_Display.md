The display Property
The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The <div> element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:

    <div>
    <h1> - <h6>
    <p>
    <form>
    <header>
    <footer>
    <section>


Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>


Display: none;
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.

The <script> element uses display: none; as default.
