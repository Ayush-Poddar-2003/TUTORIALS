# CSS Combinators

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- descendant selector (space)
- child selector (>)
- adjacent sibling selector (+)
- general sibling selector (~)

---
## Descendant Selector
The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

---
## Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.


Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

---
## General Sibling Selector (~)
The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
