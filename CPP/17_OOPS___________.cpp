What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

OOPS has several advantages :
   - Faster and easier to execute
   - Clear structure of programs
   - Helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself".
   - Codes are easier to maintain, modify and debug.
   - Less code and shorter development time

PROCEDURAL VS OOPS -

In procedural programming
    - Program is divided into small parts called functions.
    - Follows top-down approach.
    - No access specifier hence less secure.
    - No concept of data hiding and inheritance.
    - Function is more important than the data.
    - Examples: C, Pascal etc.

In object oriented programming
    - Program is divided into small parts called objects.
    - Follows bottom up approach.
    - Has access specifier hence more secure.
    - Has concept of data hiding and inheritance.
    - Data is more important than the function.
    - Examples: C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.
